ENV(Enviroment veriable):

it used to save important information example password user id email because react is an
client side libuary and all code code translate in browser that can be accesseble by every
one so some information is very import to protect that is why we used ENV this information
can shere with trustful people or platform like aws it in market many of because when we 
send or web other serviror.

For ENV had better to make it in the root of our project mean where the my packed.json are 
present. github meant mean file.
To create EVN file : we strat with . (.) is most important to make it and other in small ex

.env
